This Pebble smartwatch application can run on the original Pebble, the Pebble Time, as well as the Pebble Time Round. By investigating the API used to populate the computer lab availability graphic on the campus library website, this application displays computer availability as well as individual computer status reports. The application currently supports 10 computer labs on the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University campus. 

Vivew the current [published version of the application here](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/56fda334a091ba5b7a00000e?query=erau&section=watchapps) in the Pebble appstore.
